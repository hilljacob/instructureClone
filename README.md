Getting ready for interviews I am going to start cloning sites of companies that I would love to work for. That being said I am going to start with cloning the Landing Page of Instructure.

What I am Using is to do this clone ---
Angular as an MVC - Help future proof incase i do more than just that landing page.
HTML/CSS -- it's gotta look good.
jQuery-- rockets gotta fly!

fun things-----
1 blue word changes
2 on hover images change and rocket shakes
3 footer box moves
